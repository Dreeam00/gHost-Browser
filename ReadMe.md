**IFoxer** is an open source lightweight web browser developed based on C# and .NET 9, with an emphasis on customizability and ease of learning. It uses `WebView2` as a rendering engine that supports the latest web standards and provides a modern browsing experience. This project aims to be a learning material for Windows Forms application development and a starting point for developers who want to create their own browser.
